## Tech

JBook uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS](https://github.com/topics/react) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [markdown-it]() - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [node.js]() - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express]() - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
  to Markdown converter
- [esBuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) - An awesome package bundler and code transpiler!

And of course JBook itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/shrivastavasamarth22/jbook)
on GitHub.
